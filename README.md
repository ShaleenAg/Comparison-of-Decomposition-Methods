# Comparison-of-Decomposition-Methods
We have compared different Matric Decomposition Methods on the basis of re-construction accuracy error, time taken etc. In the SVD file we have immplemented SVD and its variants and tried to compare them while in the 2nd file we implemented decomposition methods namely
<ul>
  <li> LU Decompistion </li>
  <li> Interpolative Decomposition </li>
  <li> Rank Revealing QR Decomposition </li>
  <li> QR Decomposition </li>
  <li> Eigen Decomposition </li>
  <li> Cholesky Decomposition </li>
  <li> Sparse LU Decomposition </li>
 </ul>
